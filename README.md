### What Is TIME coin (TIME)?

TIME is a stablecoin which continuously appreciates over real time, backed by multiple yield farming protocols in DeFi. Its value appreciates continuously by the amount of interest gained from yield farming.

While DeFi is the huge next wave in the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain, it is not as popular yet, given the list of inconveniences users may have to face. To provide cryptocurrency users with better accessibility to DeFi and yield farming with minimum cost, we propose TIME, a cryptocurrency token whose price appreciates every moment by the amount of interest gained through yield farming fiat stablecoins. TIME uses various blockchain networks, Time Zone Voting, Proof of Lapse, and other methods to prove that the gained interest is fairly distributed among the token owners while ensuring that issued tokens are fully backed and reserved at all times.

### How Many TIME coins Are There in Circulation?

TIME issues a new token only when there is a purchase from smart contract. Users need not to worry about price dump due to reserved TIME coins, as such does not exist. At the moment, there are <10K TIME coins purchased in the market.

### Who Are the Founders of TIME?
